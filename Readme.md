# Digital Assembly Method
This is a prototype of an interactive way of displaying 3D visualized assembly instructions. The 3D objects shown here were created in Blender, afterwards exported to .obj (Wavefront 3D Object File) and .mtl (Wavefront Material Template Library) files and finally integrated into the Dash application via plotly.
This project was created as part of a bachelor's thesis.
